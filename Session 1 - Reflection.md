# Session 1 - Reflection

## Initial reflections on software engineering.
software engineering is a broad concept that can be divided into many case-specific subtasks.

this notion includes working with code as well as designing architecture, testing, and communicating with the client.


## Reflect on the software you use daily. Which category does it fall into?

I'd like to start with the most basic software -- operating systems, every person, whether they want to or not, works with an operating system every day. when paying at the supermarket with a card, when using a TV or a coffee machine.
Speaking about the type of operating system as a product, today it is impossible to refer to it as a package, as companies are making steps towards operating system as a service. for example, Windows 365, which is provided as a cloud service.

but also operating systems are distributed as packages that can be easily downloaded by the user.

In conclusion about operating systems, I would like to say that such software can be distributed in different ways.

When talking about everyday programs used by users, we can also conclude that companies are moving away from the package distribution model. they prefer to provide a service. as the revenues from this model are much higher. let's take Microsoft office as an example, we have the opportunity to buy a subscription to office 365, with the latest features, but at the same time we can download the package. each distribution model has its pros and cons.

software as a service pros:
- you always get the newest features when they are released
- quick fixes for bugs and vulnerabilities

cons:
- you have to pay for the service every month
- you have to be connected to the internet to use the service
- you have to trust the company that provides the service

program as a package pros:
- you pay once and use it forever
- you don't have to be connected to the internet to use the program
- you don't have to trust the company that provides the service
- you can use the program on any device
- you can use the program without an account

cons:
- you don't get the latest features
- you don't get quick fixes for bugs and vulnerabilities
- you have to pay for the next version of the program
- you have to download the program and install it
- you have to update the program yourself

In conclusion of this document I want to highlight the main disadvantage of the software as a service approach. in fact you do not own the program, the company that provides the service can change the terms of provision, which will fundamentally change the use. for this reason at the moment I am more in favor of package distribution of software. but I also do not refuse services, but I try to reduce their presence in my life.
